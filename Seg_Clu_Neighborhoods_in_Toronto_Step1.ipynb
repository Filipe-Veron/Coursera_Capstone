Ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned.<br>\n-More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. \n For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: \n Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a \n comma as shown in row 11 in the above table.<br>\n-If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough.<br>\n-Clean your Notebook and add Markdown cells to explain your work and any assumptions you are making.<br>\n-In the last cell of your notebook, use the .shape method to print the number of rows of your dataframe.<br>\n<p><b>4-Submit a link to your Notebook on your Github repository.</b></p>\n"
